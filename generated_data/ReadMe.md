# Generated data folder
If the option to serialise models and stats when running a grid search is activated, the models are saved in different subfolders of this folder. The folder names contain information the optimizer and learning rates used to train the models.

Since some of the file were over  200mb the files generated from the experiments were rather placed in this google drive folder: [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17c7PySAorwY0P0VVEdMLnEwskU3yQMyT?usp=sharing)
